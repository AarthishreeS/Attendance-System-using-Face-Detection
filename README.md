# Attendance-System-using-Face-Detection

This Attendance system project,is developed using Python and opencv library.

It uses Haar cascades to recognize faces, making it highly accurate and reliable. It also has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter
This attendance system uses hierarchical search functionality, which enables administrators to quickly and easily search for specific users or groups of users within the system. This is particularly useful for managing attendance in large organizations or institutions.
The system is designed to be scalable and supports multiple clients, making it suitable for use in a wide range of contexts.

The python_bt.py file analysis these search algorithms:
Breadth first search
Depth first search
Exponential search
Iterative Deepening search
Moris search
Backtrack serach
Greedy best worst search
Hierarchial search
Depth limited search
Binary search
The Search_analysis.jpeg contains the results for the time taken for the searches.
